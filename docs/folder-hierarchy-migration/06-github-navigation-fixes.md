# GitHub Provider Navigation Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect folder names**: "unidentified-markdown-manager" instead of proper repository name
2. **Empty folder navigation**: Expanding folders shows empty content
3. **Branch switching problems**: Breadcrumb shows incorrect paths
4. **API structure mismatch**: Frontend expected recursive tree, backend returned flat list

## Root Causes

### 1. Repository Property Handling
- Frontend GitHubProvider constructor used `repository.repo_owner || repository.owner` 
- If these properties were undefined, resulted in "undefined-undefined" in folder names
- No fallback handling for missing repository properties

### 2. API Response Structure Mismatch
- Backend `/tree` endpoint returns flat list of root-level items only
- Frontend `GitHubTreeConverter.convertGitHubTreeToFileNodes` expected full recursive tree
- Missing conversion logic for flat API response to hierarchical structure

### 3. Path Navigation Issues
- `getFilesInPath` method was trying to filter from full tree for subfolder navigation
- Not properly handling GitHub API `getRepositoryContents` for specific folder paths
- Path mapping between internal paths and GitHub API paths was incorrect

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Repository Property Handling
```javascript
// Safe property extraction with fallbacks
const owner = repository.repo_owner || repository.owner;
const name = repository.repo_name || repository.name;
const safeOwner = owner || 'unknown';
const safeName = name || 'repository';
this.rootPath = `/GitHub/${safeOwner}-${safeName}/${branch}`;
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logging to track repository object structure
- Added path resolution logging for troubleshooting navigation

### 3. Fixed Tree Structure Conversion
- Added `convertFlatTreeToHierarchy` method for flat API responses
- Proper filtering for markdown files and directories
- Correct path mapping for internal vs GitHub paths

### 4. Enhanced Folder Navigation
- Modified `getFilesInPath` to handle different path scenarios:
  - Root path: Returns tree structure from API
  - Subfolder paths: Uses `getRepositoryContents` for specific folders
  - Proper path extraction from internal to GitHub API format

### 5. Improved Path Handling
```javascript
async getFilesInPath(path) {
  // Handle root path
  if (path === this.rootPath || path === '' || path === '/') {
    const treeStructure = await this.getTreeStructure();
    return treeStructure[0]?.children || [];
  }
  
  // Handle subfolder paths
  if (path.startsWith(this.rootPath)) {
    const githubPath = path.replace(this.rootPath, '').replace(/^\//, '');
    // Make API call for specific folder
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

✅ **Correct folder names**: Should show "LittleDan9-markdown-manager" instead of "unidentified"
✅ **Working folder navigation**: Expanding folders should show their contents
✅ **Proper breadcrumbs**: Path should reflect actual repository and branch structure
✅ **Smooth branch switching**: Navigation state should update correctly when switching branches

## Testing

The fixes include debug logging to help identify any remaining issues:
- Repository object structure logging in constructor
- Path resolution logging in `getFilesInPath`
- API response logging in `getTreeStructure`

Monitor browser console for these debug messages to verify the fixes are working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Test folder navigation in the file browser
2. Test branch switching functionality
3. Verify breadcrumb display
4. Remove debug logging once issues are confirmed resolved
