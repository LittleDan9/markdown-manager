const { icons, totalCount } = await iconService.searchIconsBatch({
  query: 'aws',
  pages: [0, 1, 2], // Load 3 pages at once
  pageSize: 24,
  includeSvg: true // Get SVG data immediately
});

// Intelligent prefetching
iconService.enablePrefetching({
  strategy: 'usage-based', // or 'category-based', 'related'
  lookahead: 2, // Prefetch 2 pages ahead
  categories: ['aws', 'logos'] // Focus on relevant categories
