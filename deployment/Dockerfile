# Dockerfile removed - using native Ansible deployment
# 
# This containerized approach caused unnecessary complexity with:
# - Volume mounting issues
# - Path resolution problems  
# - Container context limitations
#
# Native Ansible installation provides:
# - Direct access to source code
# - Simpler debugging
# - Better integration with development workflow
#
# Installation handled by: scripts/setup-ansible.sh
