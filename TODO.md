You are correctâ€”your DocumentProvider is handling a lot of logic, and the dual backend/localStorage support is making it complex and harder to maintain. Here are concrete steps to refactor and improve maintainability, reliability, and clarity:

1. Abstract Storage Logic
Create a "DocumentStorage" abstraction (class or module) that exposes a unified API for CRUD operations, but internally handles localStorage and backend sync. This keeps your provider clean and focused on state, not storage details.

DocumentStorage.saveDocument(doc)
DocumentStorage.deleteDocument(id)
DocumentStorage.getAllDocuments()
etc.
This module should:

Always write to localStorage first.
If authenticated, sync changes to the backend (and resolve conflicts if needed).
Handle network errors gracefully, queueing changes for later sync if offline.
2. Provider Only Manages State
Refactor DocumentProvider to:

Use the storage abstraction for all document/category operations.
Only manage React state, loading, and error handling.
Remove all direct localStorage and backend API calls from the provider.
3. Sync on Auth Change
When a user logs in:

Sync any local-only documents to the backend.
Optionally, merge backend and localStorage documents (resolving conflicts by timestamp or prompting the user).
When a user logs out:

Optionally, clear backend-only state, but keep localStorage for offline use.
4. Error Handling and Offline Support
If backend sync fails, keep localStorage as the source of truth and retry sync in the background.
Optionally, show a "syncing" or "offline" indicator in the UI.
5. Testing and Linting
With logic abstracted, you can more easily test storage and sync logic in isolation.
Provider becomes easier to reason about and maintain.
Example Structure
DocumentStorage.js (pseudo-API)

DocumentProvider.jsx

Summary:

Move all storage/sync logic to a dedicated module.
Provider only manages state and calls the storage API.
Always write to localStorage, sync to backend if authenticated.
Handle errors and offline gracefully.
Would you like a starter implementation for the DocumentStorage abstraction and a refactored DocumentProvider?

Here are some additional storage features you might consider for DocumentStorage.js:

Document Versioning/History:

Store previous versions of documents for undo/restore functionality.
Useful for recovering from accidental changes or deletions.
Document Backup/Restore:

Export all documents/categories as a JSON file for backup.
Import/restore from a backup file.
Conflict Detection/Resolution:

Detect if a document has changed on the backend since last sync.
Prompt user to resolve conflicts (merge, overwrite, etc.).
Offline Change Queue:

Queue changes made while offline and sync them when reconnected.
Useful for robust offline-first experiences.
Document Sharing/Collaboration:

Store and manage shared documents or collaboration invitations.
Track which documents are shared and with whom.
Category Management Enhancements:

Allow category color/icon customization and persist those settings.
Store category metadata (description, order, etc.).
Document Favorites/Pinning:

Mark documents as favorites or pin them for quick access.
Store favorite/pinned status in localStorage.
Document Tagging:

Support tags in addition to categories for flexible organization.
Store and manage tags per document.
Audit Log:

Track and store a log of all document/category operations for troubleshooting or analytics.
Storage Usage Stats:

Track and report storage usage (number of documents, total size, etc.).

## Markdown Rendering

* Add margins around the mermaid contianer of like 4px top and bottom.
* Is there a way to add small bottom margin to the `# Heading` in the markdown.

## Autosave

* Not trigging at a consistent interval
* Seems that on complete, editor insertion point is moved to line 0, char 0.
* On autosave, some data is being lost as I think the save might be updating the editor content, which also might be the cause for the item above.

## Preview Pane

* Is there a way to keep the preview pane in focus with what is being typed?
* Syntax highlight color choices are not great. Python look like a giant warning block.
* The `inline-code` is an ugly red also.
* Syntax highlighter is running on each key stroke but the final render is not displaying in the document. Hitting the back space pulls the current from cache, but most recent run is not sticky.
* Style Markdown Tables better

## GitHub Integration Options

Great idea! GitHub integration would add significant value to the markdown manager. Here are the possibilities I can envision:

Core GitHub Integration Features
Authentication & User Management
GitHub OAuth login - Streamlined signup/login process
Profile sync - Pull GitHub profile info (avatar, name, bio)
Repository permissions - Respect private/public repo access
Repository Operations
Repository browser - List user's repos, browse folder structures
Import from repo - Load markdown files directly from GitHub repos
Export to repo - Save documents as files to existing or new repos
Branch management - Work with different branches, create feature branches
Advanced Workflow Features
Git integration - Commit messages, commit history, file versioning
Pull request creation - Direct PR creation from edited documents
Collaboration - Share documents via repo invites, track contributors
Sync status - Show when local changes differ from repo versions
Content Management
README editing - Special handling for README.md files with live preview
Documentation workflows - Edit docs/ folders, maintain documentation sites
Issue integration - Link documents to GitHub issues, create issues from notes
Wiki management - Edit GitHub wiki pages directly
Publishing & Sharing
GitHub Pages integration - Deploy markdown as static sites
Gist integration - Save/load from GitHub Gists for quick sharing
Release notes - Create and manage release documentation
Project documentation - Maintain project docs with automatic syncing
Developer-Focused Features
Code snippet management - Extract/embed code from repos into documents
API documentation - Generate docs from code comments/schemas
Changelog automation - Generate changelogs from commit history
Badge integration - Embed repo status badges, CI/CD status
Advanced Possibilities
Multi-repo projects - Work across multiple related repositories
Template system - Create document templates from successful repo patterns
Automated backups - Auto-commit document changes with configurable intervals
Conflict resolution - Handle merge conflicts when multiple editors work on same docs
This would transform the tool from a simple markdown editor into a comprehensive documentation and content management platform for developers. The GitHub ecosystem integration would make it particularly valuable for open source projects and development teams.

Would you like me to explore implementing any specific feature first, like GitHub OAuth authentication or repository browsing?
