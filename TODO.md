You are correctâ€”your DocumentProvider is handling a lot of logic, and the dual backend/localStorage support is making it complex and harder to maintain. Here are concrete steps to refactor and improve maintainability, reliability, and clarity:

1. Abstract Storage Logic
Create a "DocumentStorage" abstraction (class or module) that exposes a unified API for CRUD operations, but internally handles localStorage and backend sync. This keeps your provider clean and focused on state, not storage details.

DocumentStorage.saveDocument(doc)
DocumentStorage.deleteDocument(id)
DocumentStorage.getAllDocuments()
etc.
This module should:

Always write to localStorage first.
If authenticated, sync changes to the backend (and resolve conflicts if needed).
Handle network errors gracefully, queueing changes for later sync if offline.
2. Provider Only Manages State
Refactor DocumentProvider to:

Use the storage abstraction for all document/category operations.
Only manage React state, loading, and error handling.
Remove all direct localStorage and backend API calls from the provider.
3. Sync on Auth Change
When a user logs in:

Sync any local-only documents to the backend.
Optionally, merge backend and localStorage documents (resolving conflicts by timestamp or prompting the user).
When a user logs out:

Optionally, clear backend-only state, but keep localStorage for offline use.
4. Error Handling and Offline Support
If backend sync fails, keep localStorage as the source of truth and retry sync in the background.
Optionally, show a "syncing" or "offline" indicator in the UI.
5. Testing and Linting
With logic abstracted, you can more easily test storage and sync logic in isolation.
Provider becomes easier to reason about and maintain.
Example Structure
DocumentStorage.js (pseudo-API)

DocumentProvider.jsx

Summary:

Move all storage/sync logic to a dedicated module.
Provider only manages state and calls the storage API.
Always write to localStorage, sync to backend if authenticated.
Handle errors and offline gracefully.
