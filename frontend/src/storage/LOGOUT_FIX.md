# Logout 403 Error Fix

## Problem
During logout, the new DocumentManager system was still trying to sync operations to the backend after the user's authentication token was invalidated, causing 403 errors.

## Root Cause
The sync queue was still processing operations when logout occurred, and there wasn't proper protection against authentication errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced DocumentSyncService
- ✅ Added authentication checks in `_processOperation()`
- ✅ Added 403/authentication error detection in `processQueue()`
- ✅ Stop processing queue immediately on authentication errors
- ✅ Clear `isProcessingQueue` flag during `clearQueue()`
- ✅ Added logging to queue methods for better debugging

### 2. Improved StorageEventHandler
- ✅ Better logging during logout process
- ✅ Ensure proper order: clear sync first, then clear storage

### 3. Enhanced useSyncDocuments Hook
- ✅ Skip sync entirely if not authenticated
- ✅ Handle 403 errors gracefully (no error messages)
- ✅ Only show sync errors if still authenticated

### 4. Better Error Handling
- ✅ 403 errors now stop sync processing immediately
- ✅ No more error messages for expected authentication failures
- ✅ Graceful degradation when user logs out

## How It Works Now

1. **During Logout:**
   - AuthProvider calls `DocumentManager.handleLogout()`
   - DocumentSyncService immediately clears queue and sets `isAuthenticated = false`
   - Any ongoing operations are stopped
   - Local storage is cleared

2. **If 403 Occurs:**
   - Sync service detects authentication error
   - Immediately stops all sync operations
   - Clears the queue to prevent further attempts
   - No error messages shown to user

3. **Protection Layers:**
   - Authentication checks before queueing operations
   - Authentication checks before processing operations
   - 403 error detection during processing
   - Graceful handling in UI hooks

## Result
✅ No more 403 errors during logout
✅ Clean separation between authenticated and guest states
✅ Better user experience with no confusing error messages
✅ Robust error handling for edge cases
