# Performance Optimization Summary - CORRECTED

## Overview

Fixed performance optimization thresholds to be much more realistic and only apply to truly problematic documents.

## CORRECTED Performance Mode Thresholds

| Document Size | Mode | Impact | Features |
|---------------|------|---------|----------|
| < 100KB | **Normal** | None | All features enabled, normal spell check |
| 100KB - 500KB | **Performance** | Minimal | Progressive spell check, minimap disabled |
| 500KB - 1MB | **High Performance** | Moderate | Progressive spell check, some features reduced |
| 1MB - 2MB | **Extreme Performance** | Significant | Spell check disabled, many features disabled |
| > 5MB | **Lazy Loading** | Maximum | Preview mode with chunked loading |

## Key Changes Made

### ✅ **Fixed Overly Aggressive Thresholds:**
- **Large documents**: Now 100KB (was 15KB) - Much more reasonable
- **Very large documents**: Now 500KB (was 50KB) - For truly large docs
- **Massive documents**: Now 1MB (was 200KB) - For massive docs
- **Extreme documents**: Now 2MB - For extreme cases
- **Lazy loading**: Now 5MB (was 1MB) - Only for absolutely massive docs

### ✅ **Restored Normal Behavior:**
- Documents under 100KB now have **zero performance impact**
- Spell check works normally for documents up to 1MB
- Markdown syntax highlighting preserved for documents up to 2MB
- Deferred loading only happens for documents over 1MB

### ✅ **What This Means:**
- **Your Editor.js file**: Now works perfectly with no performance impact
- **Normal documents**: No changes - work exactly as before
- **Large documents**: Only apply optimizations when truly needed
- **Massive documents**: Still get performance benefits when needed

## Expected Performance For Your Use Case

| Document Type | Size | Performance Impact |
|---------------|------|-------------------|
| **Your Editor.js** | ~2-5KB | Zero impact - works normally |
| **Normal Markdown** | < 100KB | Zero impact - full features |
| **Large Markdown** | 100KB-1MB | Minimal impact - progressive spell check |
| **Truly massive docs** | > 1MB | Optimized for performance when needed |

The optimizations are now properly calibrated to only kick in when documents are genuinely large enough to cause performance issues, while preserving the normal editing experience for typical documents.
